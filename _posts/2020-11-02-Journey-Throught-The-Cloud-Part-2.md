In part two of our Journey Through the Cloud we're going to talk a little bit more about our overall desired endstate of our architecture. This will focus more on our end user expereince and best pracitces in regards to security, and not so much on the CI/CD process of our Jekyll site. If you're a fan of CloudFront and or Origin Access Identity this will be the blog for you!
