In this blog series we’ll walk through why and how we chose our technology stack for our rebranding initiative here at masterthe.cloud. We’ll cover some intermediate Terraform, Static Site Generators (SSG), and some core AWS services. Additionally, there will be a video on our youtube channel towards the end combining all of the blog posts. This first part will cover Static Site Generators, what they are, and why chose the one we did.
